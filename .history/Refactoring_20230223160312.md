# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

The changes made to the deterministicPartitionKey function to improve its readability and conciseness are:

1. The constants TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY and MAX_PARTITION_KEY_LENGTH were moved outside the function to make them more visible. As constants, they 
2. The optional chaining (?.) operator was used to simplify the logic for setting the candidate variable, which is now set to event?.partitionKey if it exists or to the hash of JSON.stringify(event) (or the TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY if event is falsy).
3. The if-else structure was simplified by chaining the conditions using the OR (||) operator.
4. Unnecessary curly braces were removed to make the code more concise.
5. The else block after the if (candidate) block was removed because it was not necessary.
6. The unnecessary type check for candidate was removed because it is always a string at that point in the function.
